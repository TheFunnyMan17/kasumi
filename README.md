## Introduction

hi :3

This is my hobby operating system I started to learn more about Rust.
I'm still learning Rust so I'm not sure if this is a good idea (hint: it really isn't), but, uhh... fortune favors the bold, I guess...?

Sidenote, I was inspired to make this OS by, of all things, the character of Basil from OMORI.
Thanks Basil!

No idea where this will end up (probably like the other 12 abandoned projects I start and abandon immediatly after starting them).

## Getting Started

Don't even try. I'm not good enough to make my stuff redistributable yet. Sorry.
(To be serious, I'm working on it, should be done Eventually(TM))

## Contributing

I... don't know.
I'd love to hear your ideas, but I've *never* worked in a team before, so I'd be... like, the worst person to work with.

I'll figure it out, I promise.
